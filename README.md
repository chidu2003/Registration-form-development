This project focuses on the development of a registration form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The registration form serves as a crucial component for gathering user information and facilitating user registration processes on websites or web applications.
The registration form offers a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to input their details conveniently.
The form incorporates password strength validation, requiring users to create strong passwords that meet specific criteria, such as including capital letters, special characters, and having a minimum length.
To enhance security and accuracy, the form includes a password confirmation field, ensuring users correctly re-enter their chosen password.
